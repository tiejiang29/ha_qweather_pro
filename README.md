## A deeply customized advanced QWeather (HeWeather) integration for Home Assistant.  
Rebuilt using the latest 2026 development standards, delivering not only highly accurate meteorological data but also ultra-fast native SVG weather cards and professional-grade detail popups.

## ✨ Core Features

- 🛡️ **Security First**  
  - Supports QWeather’s latest JWT (EdDSA) authentication.  
  - Automatically generates local Ed25519 key pairs to protect your API quota from unauthorized use.

- ⚡ **Extreme Performance**
  - **Backend:** Powered by DataUpdateCoordinator with concurrent requests and smart caching to minimize API usage.
  - **Frontend:** Removes heavy libraries like Chart.js; uses native SVG to render temperature trend curves with 10× faster performance.

- 📊 **Deep Data**
  - **Minutely precipitation:** Native API-driven minute-level precipitation summary (e.g., “No precipitation in the next two hours”).
  - **Weather summary:** Logically synthesized hourly weather trend summary.
  - **Rich sensors:** AQI (with detailed components), today’s temperature range, alert count, weather summary, and more.

- 🎨 **Professional Visuals**
  - **Dashboard card:** Faithfully recreates the look of premium weather apps, supporting 7-day and 24-hour forecast switching.
  - **Custom detail popup:** When enabled, replaces HA’s default popup with lifestyle indices, alert details, and more.

- 🔄 **Latest Standards**  
  - Fully compatible with HA 2024.3+ WebSocket forecast subscription for long-term smooth operation.

## 🌍 Internationalization & Multi-language Support (i18n)

QWeather Pro  internationalized, providing a seamless localized experience for users worldwide.

- **Automatic Language Sync**: The integration automatically detects your Home Assistant system language (Settings -> System -> General) and requests weather data in the matching language (supporting 30+ languages).
- **Smart Fallback Mechanism**:
  - **Core Weather/Alerts/AQI**: Supports all 30+ languages provided by QWeather API (e.g., German, French, Japanese, etc.).
  - **Minutely Precipitation & Life Indices**: Due to API constraints, these specific fields will automatically fallback to **English** if the system language is not Chinese, ensuring stable data delivery.
- **Localized Titles & IDs**: During the setup flow, the integration fetches and locks the city name based on your current language (e.g., "BeiJing" in Chinese or "BeiJing" in English), generating clean, localized Entity IDs.
